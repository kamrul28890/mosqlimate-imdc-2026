## 3. Libraries and dependencies

Python 3.10 (conda environment). Core libraries:

- **Data & numerics:** pandas, numpy, scipy, pyarrow
- **Modeling:** **LightGBM** (quantile regression), **PyTorch** (GRU), scikit-learn, statsmodels
- **Geospatial:** geopandas
- **Epi/challenge:** epiweeks, **mosqlient** (Mosqlimate API client for registration/upload)
- **Reporting:** matplotlib, pymupdf, nbconvert; tectonic for LaTeX

Exact, pinned versions are in `environment.lock.yml` (full `conda env export`) and
`requirements-freeze.txt` (`pip freeze`); the minimal portable spec is `environment.yml`.
Setup instructions are in [Setup and reproduction](#setup-and-reproduction).

> **Runtime note:** set `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` whenever LightGBM/XGBoost and PyTorch are
> imported in the same process (each links its own libomp). All `run_*` scripts set it automatically.

---

## 4. Data and variables

All data are from the **official IMDC 2026 dataset** (`data/raw/data_imdc_2026/`, tracked via Git
LFS and fingerprinted in `data/raw/data_imdc_2026/CHECKSUMS.sha256`) and public sources. **No
private or additional non-shared datasets were used.** Inputs:

- **Case counts** — weekly dengue and chikungunya cases per municipality (SINAN / Infodengue),
  aggregated to the 26 mandatory states (Espírito Santo excluded, per the rules) and to the target
  cities.
- **Climate** — ERA5 reanalysis (observed) and ECMWF **seasonal forecasts** (future covariate).
- **Ocean/climate indices** — ENSO, IOD, PDO.
- **Static covariates** — population, Köppen climate / biome classification, health-region geometries.
- **Search-access signal** — Afya Whitebook.

Models work in **log1p-incidence space** (cases per population). Engineered features
(`src/imdc/features/panel.py`): autoregressive case lags, rolling statistics, a same-epiweek
seasonal anchor, calendar harmonics, population-weighted state climate summaries, ocean-index lags,
and static climate-zone composition. All inputs are redistributable within the challenge; the raw
archive is included via Git LFS for reproduction.

## 5. Model training process

Four submission tracks; the best model is chosen **per track** by fold-1 tuning plus scale-free
relative WIS:

| Track | Model chosen |
|-------|--------------|
| **Dengue, state** | Unweighted quantile-median **ensemble** of climatological + LightGBM + GRU, with conformal recalibration |
| **Chikungunya, state** | **LightGBM** quantile regression (dominates every fold; the ensemble dilutes it) |
| **Dengue / chikungunya, cities** | **Climatological-quantile** model (geography-agnostic; strongest at city level) |

**Training design.** All models train on a **synthetic-origin panel** (weekly forecast origins ×
horizons 1–67 weeks) with strict leakage-safe cutoff filtering (see §6). Backtests cover the four
official validation seasons (2022–23, 2023–24, 2024–25, 2025–26).

**Individual models.**
- **Baselines** — naive, seasonal-naive, and a climatological-quantile model (empirical quantiles
  of historical same-epiweek incidence).
- **LightGBM** — gradient-boosted quantile regression at the nine required levels, log1p-incidence
  framing, deterministic (`seed=42`), with **conformalized quantile regression (CQR)** calibration.
- **GRU** — a small global recurrent network with a negative-binomial head, run as a **5-member
  deep ensemble** (seeds averaged).
- **Mechanistic** — a compartmental/renewal-style model producing bootstrap trajectories with a
  negative-binomial observation model.
- **Ensemble** — per-quantile median (Vincentization) of the member quantiles, followed by
  **conformal recalibration** of the tails (the single largest accuracy gain; see §7).

Full methodology, per-fold analysis, and the WIS scale-dependence findings are in
`reports/modeling_results_report.pdf` and the manuscript (`paper/imdc_paper.pdf`). Every step is
reproducible with `make reproduce`.

## 6. How the EW‑25 data-availability rule was met

The challenge requires that a forecast covering **EW 41 of the current year through EW 40 of the
following year** use **only data available up to EW 25 of the current year**. We enforce this
mechanically, not by convention:

- **Fold boundaries come from the organizers' own flags.** Backtest windows are derived at runtime
  from the `train_N` / `target_N` columns the challenge ships in the case tables
  (`src/imdc/data/folds.py::get_folds`); the last training date is the fold's EW‑25 cutoff. Nothing
  is hardcoded, so the pipeline stays correct if the dataset is refreshed.
- **Every joined table is explicitly date-filtered to the cutoff.** Only the case tables carry fold
  flags; climate, ocean-index, and search-access tables are filtered with `cutoff_filter`
  (`date <= cutoff`, inclusive), which also excludes the ~15-week unflagged gap between each
  training cutoff and the target window. No feature can see a value dated after EW 25.
- **The ECMWF seasonal *forecast* product is filtered by issue date, not target date.** It is a
  legitimate future covariate only when the forecast was *issued* on or before the cutoff, so
  `cutoff_filter_forecasting_climate` keeps rows whose `reference_month <= cutoff month` — never a
  forecast issued later that happens to describe the target period.
- **A hard leakage assertion guards the whole pipeline.** `src/imdc/data/validate.py::assert_no_leakage`
  raises if any training row is dated beyond the cutoff, and `tests/` includes dedicated leakage
  tests so a future refactor cannot silently reintroduce it.
- **The real 2026–27 forecast uses the same machinery.** `get_forecast_origin` sets the forecast
  origin to the latest observed date in the (EW‑25-truncated) dataset, and all covariates pass
  through the same cutoff filters before the forecast horizon (EW 41 2026 → EW 40 2027) is produced.

## 7. How the prediction intervals were computed

Every forecast is a **full predictive distribution**: a median plus the required **50/80/90/95%
central intervals**. Uncertainty is produced natively per model and then combined:

- **Climatological** — empirical quantiles of historical same-epiweek incidence.
- **LightGBM** — quantile regression at the nine required levels, with **conformalized quantile
  regression (CQR)** calibration so nominal intervals achieve nominal coverage.
- **GRU** — a negative-binomial predictive head, ensembled over 5 seeds.
- **Mechanistic** — bootstrap trajectories with a negative-binomial observation model.
- **Ensemble** — per-quantile **median (Vincentization)** of the member quantiles, followed by a
  **conformal recalibration** step (multiplicative CQR widening factors tuned on held-out
  validation folds) that corrects residual over-confidence in the tails.

Interval **nesting** (50 ⊂ 80 ⊂ 90 ⊂ 95) and **non-negativity** are enforced, and every file is
validated against the platform schema before upload (`src/imdc/submission/validate.py`).

## Results

Backtest over 26 states × 4 seasons (2022–23 … 2025–26). Mean Weighted Interval Score (WIS) and
official normalized WIS (Σ WIS / Σ cases), both lower-is-better:

| Model | WIS | normWIS | Coverage 50/80/90/95 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ensemble + conformal recalibration** | **1216** | **0.555** | 47/76/88/93% |
| Ensemble (Vincentization) | 1281 | 0.585 | 46/76/84/88% |
| Ensemble (inverse-WIS) | 1287 | 0.588 | 48/76/86/89% |
| LightGBM (CQR) | 1299 | 0.593 | 51/81/89/93% |
| Mechanistic | 1303 | 0.595 | 53/79/85/89% |
| Climatological | 1327 | 0.606 | 48/73/82/85% |
| GRU (NegBinom) | 1373 | 0.627 | 32/57/68/75% |
| Seasonal-naive | 1459 | 0.666 | — |
| Naive | 1664 | 0.760 | — |

**No single model wins every season** — the GRU is best on normal seasons but fails on the 2024
outlier; LightGBM is most robust to the outlier but weakest on normal seasons. The unweighted
quantile-median **ensemble is never worst on any fold**, and **conformal recalibration** of the
ensemble's tails is the largest single accuracy gain (WIS 1281 → 1216).

## Setup and reproduction

### 1. Clone (with LFS — the raw data is ~800 MB)
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/kamrul28890/3rd_imdc_purdue_neuralearth.git
cd 3rd_imdc_purdue_neuralearth
git lfs pull        # fetches data/raw/data_imdc_2026/
```

### 2. Environment (conda; LightGBM/XGBoost from conda-forge for a working libomp)
```bash
conda create -n py310 python=3.10 -y
conda install -n py310 -c conda-forge xgboost lightgbm tectonic pyarrow -y
conda activate py310
pip install -e .                       # pandas, numpy, torch, statsmodels, geopandas, mosqlient, ...
pip install pytest ipykernel nbconvert pymupdf python-dotenv
```

### 3. Reproduce
```bash
make reproduce        # all models → ensemble → optional tracks → submissions → figures → manifest
make reproduce-fast   # reuse the committed GRU predictions (skip the ~55-min GRU retrain)
make test             # full test suite, incl. determinism guards
```
Every model's scored predictions are already committed in `results/metrics/*_scored.csv`, so you do
**not** need to re-run anything to inspect or build on the results.

**Reproducibility guarantees.** (1) Determinism — baselines, LightGBM (`seed=42`), and the
mechanistic model reproduce bit-for-bit (`tests/test_determinism.py`); the GRU is seeded but only
bit-reproducible on CPU, so the committed `gru_scored.csv` is canonical. (2) One command — the
`Makefile` runs every step in dependency order. (3) Provenance — `scripts/make_manifest.py` writes
`RESULTS.md` with the git commit, a SHA-256 fingerprint of the raw inputs, and the leaderboards.
(4) Pinned environment — `environment.lock.yml` (exact) and `environment.yml` (portable).
(5) Committed outputs — `results/metrics/*.csv` are the canonical results the paper reads from.
